# triviagame

In this assignment, You'll create a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. Be sure to layout this app with valid HTML and stylish CSS.

Before You Begin

Create a GitHub repo called TriviaGame, then clone the repo to your computer.

Create a file inside of the TriviaGame folder called index.html. This is where you'll mark up all of your HTML.

Don't forget to include a script tag with the jQuery library.

Create a folder inside of the TriviaGame folder called assets.

Inside assets, create three folders: css, javascript, images

In your css folder, create a style.css file.
In your javascript folder, create an app.js file; here you'll write all of your JavaScript and jQuery.
In your images folder, save whatever images you'd like to use in this exercise.
